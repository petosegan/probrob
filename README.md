Probabilistic Robotics

What Is It?
-----------
This is a collection of modules written to demonstrate ideas from the book
'Probabilistic Robotics' by Thrun, Burgard, and Fox. The aim is to implement
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for a simulated robot in a simple
environment. At this time the simulated robot is capable of Monte Carlo
Localization based on rangefinder data and autonomous goal-finding based on a hybrid automaton

Usage
----------
Run robot_probha.py to watch the robot navigate to a goal using Monte Carlo 
Localization. Motion control is based on a hybrid automaton. Yellow dots indicate
sonar pings, red arrow is the 'flee vector' pointing away from obstacles, and blue
arrows are the particle cloud.
